# Digital Business Card

This is the first solo project from Scrimba's "Learn React" Course.  The objective was to practice making components and styling them.

## Requirements
- Build from scratch
- Fill in your own information
-  Separate components for:
    - info (photo, name, buttons, etc)
    - About
    - Interests
    - Footer (social icons)

## Dependencies
- create-react-app
- font awesome for icons

## My experience:
It was good to get my hands dirty with React again with a very simple project.  I kept making some syntax errors and through troubleshooting helped solidify some of the subleties of React (ie import React not react and from 'react' not 'React').  This was also a great opportunity for me to dust off my css skills and make a short list of CSS topics I want to freshen up.

My impression of the course so far is favorable.  I have tried many places to learn or relearn React and I really enjoy Scrimba's steady pace and frequent opportunties to practice.  I feel like I am retaining the information more than any other resource I have spent time learning react.  

## Finished Project
The styling is not perfect but I reminded myself that the goal is to learn React not CSS and to move on to the next module.
